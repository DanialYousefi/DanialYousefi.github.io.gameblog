        For this blog, we are looking at 5 game design terms and how they relate to my experience of games that relate to each term. There are many aspects to game design that are crucial for creating a successful game. In this blog, we’ll be looking at story, cooperative vs competitive, single player vs multiplayer, level design, and depth.

    <ul class="list"> <b class="smaller-title">Story Telling</b> <br> When it comes to storytelling, no game does it better than last of us. Playing Last of Us is similar to watching a movie. The game has an incredibly strong story with movie like cinematic scenes that are smoothly integrated into the gameplay. There are many other games that rely heavily on storytelling, however Last of Us in my opinion has the best execution of storytelling because of the smooth integration between gameplay and cutscenes.
        <br>
        When the game’s cutscenes kick in, the gameplay feel uninterrupted because the visuals don’t drastically change and the cutscenes are connected to the game. This creates a new realm of gaming which is in many ways like watching an interactive movie which depends on the player to progress.</ul>

    <ul class="list"> <b class="smaller-title">Cooperative vs Competitive</b><br> The pinnacle of cooperation and competition in a game has to be the popular multiplayer game Warezone. This game is a multiplayer first person shooter played in teams of 1-4 in lobbies of 50-150 players. Only one team wins. This creates an incredibly competitive space with a very satisfying reward at the end if a win if pulled off. 
        <br><br>
        With lobbies as big as 150 players, teams can only pull off an unlikely win by cooperating and planning together. Being a first person shooter, the player’s mechanical skills is just as important as the strategy played out by a team. The game can be very frustrating or very fun depending on how the game goes. When I play this game, I go through a rollercoaster of emotions depending on how the game goes. Because of how tough and competitive the game is, a win for me is one of the most satisfying wins in any game I have every played.</ul>

        <ul class="list"> <b class="smaller-title">Single player vs Multiplayer</b><br> When looking at single-player vs multiplayer, the game that comes to mind is another call of duty game called Black Ops Cold War. In this game, the difference between the single-player mode and multiplayer mode is very apparent. It’s clear that these two contrasting versions of the game are created for completely different people.
            <br><br>
            The single player mode of Cold War is heavily based on the story. There are different paths a player can take in the progression of the story leading to slightly different outcomes. There are also many cut scenes that a player can sit through if they choose. There are also side challenges and missions that a player can explore to earn bonus guns and skins. In essence, there are many different pathways to explore, a lot of which don’t have much to do with the game’s guns and mechanics.
            <br><br>
            The multiplayer on the other hand is relatively one dimensional in my opinion. There are various multiplayer game modes and maps to choose from however, the objective of the game is still to upgrade your level and guns. This portion of Cold War is focused on the competitiveness and skills players bring to the first person multiplayer shooter. To me, it almost feels like a sport where players go to train to become better. In addition, with ranked match making, players get matched with those at their own level meaning the better a player gets, the harder the multiplayer becomes.</ul>

        <br><br><br>

     <ul class="list"> <b class="smaller-title">Level Design</b><br>For level design, I chose the game Knife Hit on iPhone. This game is a simple game that only requires tapping on the screen to play. The reason I chose this game was because of its interesting take on level design. Traditionally, a games are expected to get more difficult as the game progresses. Knife Hit takes a slightly different approach. As each level is completed, the following levels definitely get harder, however in between the hard levels are a few easy levels that act as a “break”. I found this very effective because it allows me to relax a bit after experiencing a tough level. In my opinion, this approach on level design is effective in making the game easier to play for a longer period of time. </ul>

        <br><br><br>
    
    <ul class="list"> <b class="smaller-title">Game Depth</b><br>Game depth can be a determining factor in retaining a player for a long period of time. This is something that was done to me by playing Clash of Clans. This mobile game is one of the most complex games I have ever played. At first I thought the game is simple because of its visuals, however I quickly found out that there are endless aspects to work on in Clash of Clans.
        <br><br>
        The game has an incredible amount of depth. Starting with a basic city, a player has to work on gathering resources to upgrade key buildings that allow the player to level up their city. Past a certain level, players are open to be attacked by other real players online if they choose to loot your city. This creates a dilemma for the city owner because they have to balance their resources between upgrading their city and upgrading their defence system to prevent other players from looting. There are endless side challenges and upgrades to pursue for the best path to prosperity. To add to the game’s depth, there is always a time limit to how much can be done in one sitting because upgrades take hours or even days in real time. This pushed the player to come back to the game later to continue the progression. This game for me is a perfect example of a game with incredible depth. </ul>
