        For my first journal entry, I played an iPhone game called knife hit. This game is in no way a hardcore game. In fact, it’s an extremely simple game that can be played anywhere on the go. I personally don’t play games on my phone however from time to time I find myself playing knife hit even if I have an extra 5 minutes to kill on my phone. After paying attention to the game mechanics, I have identified 4 reasons why I think this game is appealing.
    </p>
    <li class="list"> <b>Visual Satisfaction:</b> I think this game works for me because of its visual satisfaction. The game starts with a circular piece in the centre of the screen with an assortment of knifes at the bottom centre of the screen. With each tap on the screen, a knife gets thrown at the centre piece. The objective of the game is to dispense all the knifes into the circular piece in the centre without having any knife hitting a previously dispensed knife. The animation, sounds and mechanics of this game are very satisfying. Every knife thrown feels like an axe thrown perfectly at a piece of wood. The satisfying mechanism of the game keeps pulling me back to play more.
    </li>
    <li class="list"> <b>Simple Mechanics:</b> I find myself liking this game because of its simplicity. All that is required for playing the game is tapping the screen and making sure your timing is right. This makes the game appealing to play in any scenario. Whether it’s between study breaks, waiting in a line, or sitting in the bus, it’s super easy to whip out knife hit and playing a few rounds.</li>
    <li class="list"> <b>Difficulty Progression:</b> The third reason I like this game is its difficulty. The level of difficulty increases dramatically from level to level therefore I never found myself getting bored of playing because the difficulty stops me from getting too far which motivates me to try again. With each level, the stakes are higher because of how difficult it was to get there. This makes the game exciting for me because I pay more attention the farther I go. Each level is also unique with new animations and graphics for the centre piece and background which bring curiosity towards what’s next. 
    </li>
    <li class="list"> <b>Rewards:</b> The fourth reason is that there are an assortment of amazing looking knifes to unlock in the game which is an incentive to play more. Each level has a few apples on the centre piece to chop with knifes. Hitting these apples are optional but beneficial because they can be used to unlock new knifes in the game’s shop. With that said, the game is also simple enough to not take too much time out of my life, which for me is a great factor.</li>
